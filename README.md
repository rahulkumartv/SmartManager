# Smart Feeder and Energy Manager (SFEM)<h1>
This is a prototype project work developed as part of our Master course work.This project is evolved from an idea to utilize the wide application of 
information technology to the energy sector. The concept is vast and we reduced the scopebecuse of the time constarint. We used online simulator and Test application for 
generating the sample data for the application.

Smart Feeder and Energy Manager (SFEM) is a web based application which improves the operational efficiency and manages the energy consumption of an electrical power distribution system.
SFEM comes with two applications,
*	Smart Feeder
*	Energy Manager

## Smart Feeder<h2>
An advanced, Web-based monitoring and troubleshooting system that keeps 24-hour watch on an electric power distribution feeder system. This application targets the power utilities which generates, transmits and distributes electric power. The system allows configuring the layout of a particular feeder which needs to be monitored. The application notifies the engineer or lineman if there is a fault occurred in the FEEDER which can be caused by overload, broken electric poles or conductors and ground faults. This will enable the engineer or lineman to immediately act on the situation and rectify the faults. 

The Smart Feeder consists of hardware and software units. The hardware units include fault detection sensors and the central unit which receives signal from each sensors located in the substation. The software unit includes a web based application which runs on a pre-configured server. 

## 	Energy Manager<h2>
This Web-based dashboard application collects consumed energy information and presents it in a customized, easy-to-use format, helping the user to better understand their facility’s energy usage. This application targets the domestic consumers like houses and institutions who consumes the electric power distributed from a FEEDER.
Energy manger consists of hardware and software units. The hardware units include smart meters which are capable to record and send the energy consumption of equipment’s which are connected to it. The software unit includes a server and web based dashboard application.
